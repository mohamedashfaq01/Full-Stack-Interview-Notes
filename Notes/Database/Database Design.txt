The overall design of a database is called schema.It represents the logical view of the entire database.
A schema contains schema objects like table, foreign key, primary key, views, columns, data types, stored procedure, etc.

Normalization: 
  It is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data.
  redundant Data= Useless Data= Same data stored in more than one place 

1NF rules:
 1) Each table cell should contain a single("atomic") value.
 2) Each records needs to be unique.

2NF
 1) Tables without composite primary key are in 2NF by default.
