The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles
 in software development that help developers create more maintainable, 
 understandable, and flexible software. Here's an explanation of each principle in simple terms with Java examples:

### S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**In Layman Terms**: Imagine a chef in a kitchen. 
If the chef has to cook, clean, manage inventory, and take orders, it's too much for one person. Similarly, a class should do only one thing.

**Example**:

```java
// Bad Example: One class doing multiple things
public class UserService {
    public void createUser(String name) {
        // logic to create user
    }
    
    public void sendEmail(String email) {
        // logic to send email
    }
}

// Good Example: Separate responsibilities
public class UserService {
    public void createUser(String name) {
        // logic to create user
    }
}

public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String email) {
        // logic to send email
    }
}
```

### O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Principle**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**In Layman Terms**: Imagine a toy with a battery compartment. You can add new batteries (extend functionality) without changing the toy's design.

**Example**:

```java
// Bad Example: Modifying the existing code to add new functionality
public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateRectangleArea(Rectangle rectangle) {
        return rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
    }
}

// Good Example: Extending functionality without modifying existing code
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double calculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return shape.calculateArea();
    }
}
```

### L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Principle**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

**In Layman Terms**: If you have a pet dog, you should be able to treat it as an animal without worrying if it's actually a cat or a bird. 
The dog should behave like an animal.

**Example**:

```java
// Bad Example: Violating LSP
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        // Fly implementation
    }
}

public class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}

// Good Example: Correcting LSP
public abstract class Bird {
    public abstract void move();
}

public class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        // Fly implementation
    }
}

public class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        // Walk implementation
    }
}
```

### I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Principle**: A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.

**In Layman Terms**: Imagine a restaurant menu. If you only want a dessert, you shouldn't be forced to order a main course.
 Similarly, interfaces should be small and specific.

**Example**:

```java
// Bad Example: One big interface with too many methods
public interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

// Good Example: Segregating interfaces
public interface Workable {
    void work();
}

public interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

public class Employee implements Workable, Eatable {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        // Work implementation
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // Eat implementation
    }
}
```

### D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
 Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**In Layman Terms**: If you have a remote control and a TV,
 the remote control should work with any TV, not just a specific model. 
 
 The remote control (high-level) should rely on an abstraction (interface), not on the TV details (low-level).

**Example**:

```java
// Bad Example: High-level module depends on low-level module
public class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() {
        // Turn on the light
    }
}

public class Switch {
    private LightBulb lightBulb = new LightBulb();

    public void operate() {
        lightBulb.turnOn();
    }
}

// Good Example: High-level module depends on abstraction
public interface Switchable {
    void turnOn();
}

public class LightBulb implements Switchable {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        // Turn on the light
    }
}

public class Switch {
    private Switchable device;

    public Switch(Switchable device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void operate() {
        device.turnOn();
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should do one thing.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be extendable without modifying the existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses should be replaceable with their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

Following these principles helps create code that is easier to maintain, extend, and understand.
