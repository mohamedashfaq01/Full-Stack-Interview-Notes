Sure! Here's a **simple and understandable summary** of the **major Angular versions**, starting from the beginning, along with their **key features**. I'll also highlight which versions are **most important** to focus on for **upskilling**.

---

Angular versions v2 to v16 are no longer under support. 

### 🌟 Background: AngularJS vs Angular

- **AngularJS (v1.x)** – Released in 2010  
  - Based on JavaScript
  - Used controllers, $scope
  - Two-way binding, MVC pattern
  - Not suitable for large-scale apps (performance issues)

🛑 **Note**: AngularJS is **completely different** from Angular (v2+). It's **obsolete now**.

---

## ✅ Modern Angular Versions (v2+)

Angular was **completely rewritten** after AngularJS.

---

### 🚀 Angular 2 (2016)
- Full rewrite in **TypeScript**
- Component-based architecture
- Dependency Injection
- Angular CLI introduced
- Routing module

📌 **Important**: First version of modern Angular

---

### ⚡ Angular 4 (2017)  
(No Angular 3 – skipped due to version mismatch in router package)

- Smaller bundle size
- Improved *ngIf and *ngFor with else block
- Angular Universal (Server-side rendering)
- Better support for TypeScript
In Angular 4, there is no need to create a pattern for email validation.

---

### 💡 Angular 5 (2017)
- Build optimizer
- Faster compilation with Angular Compiler (AOT by default)
- Improved HTTP Client (new `HttpClientModule`)
- CLI Improvemnents
- It uses rxJs 5.5+, taking advantage of improved features and operators.

---

### 🔧 Angular 6 (2018)
- **Ng update** and **Ng add** (easy package upgrades)
- Angular Elements (web components)
- Tree-shakable providers

---

### 🛠️ Angular 7 (2018)
- Virtual scrolling
- Drag and Drop module
- CLI prompts (routing and scss support)
- Better performance for large apps

---

### ⚙️ Angular 8 (2019)
- **Ivy (preview)**: new rendering engine
- Differential loading for modern vs legacy browsers
- Lazy loading using dynamic imports
- Provides FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule for handling forms.

---

### 🚨 Angular 9 (2020)
- **Ivy becomes default**
- Smaller bundle size, better debugging
- Improved testing and error messages
- Faster test completion
Default AOTs (Angular ahead-of-time).
Enhanced Internationalization
Introduced stricter types for Angular forms, improving type checks.

The underlying foundation of the entire framework has changed in Angular 9.
 The IVY renderer will be used as the default compiler in all applications. 
 Smaller apps benefit the most from IVY’s tree shaking capability because
 the angular components interactions methods require less code.
 One of Angular 9’s main goals is to make applications smaller for a better user experience. 
The team will most likely focus on developing components in the future, therefore there will be no need for a big API change.

📌 **Important**: Major shift in internal architecture

---

### 🧱 Angular 10 (2020)
- Optional strict mode in CLI
- New Date range picker in Angular Material
- Smaller npm package size

---

### 🚅 Angular 11 (2020)
- Faster builds
- Better Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Improved logging
- Use ng serve —hmr for faster builds. 

Deprecation
TSLint has been deprecated by the project’s designers, who encourage switching to ESLint.
 As a result, TSLint and Codelyzer have been deprecated in version 11.
 
Support for Internet Explorer 9/IE10 and Internet Explorer Mobile has been discontinued.

---

### 🔒 Angular 12 (2021)
- Nullish coalescing support (`??`)
- Ivy everywhere (removal of View Engine)
- Strict typing in forms

---

### 🌈 Angular 13 (2021)
- Angular Package Format (APF) simplified
- No more support for IE11
- Dynamic component creation simplified

---

### 📦 Angular 14 (2022)
- **Standalone components** (no need for NgModules)
- Typed reactive forms
- CLI auto-completion
- Banana-in-a-box Error

📌 **Important**: Great for modern, simpler architecture

---

### ⚛️ Angular 15 (2022)
- Standalone APIs stable
- Directive composition API
- Functional guards and resolvers

---

### 🧪 Angular 16 (2023)
- **Signals introduced** (reactivity system)
- Server-side rendering improvements
- Better state handling
- Support For Tailwind CSS
- New Date Range Picker Component

---

### 🔁 Angular 17 (2023)
- **Control flow syntax**: `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` in templates
- Non-destructive hydration (SSR)
- Deferrable views (load templates only when needed)
- Stable Signals API

📌 **Important**: Huge update in terms of performance and template power

---

### 🚀 Angular 18 (2024)

- Simplified zone-less app creation
- Better integration with modern tools (like Vite)

📌 **Must Learn**: Most current, modern, and future-ready version

---

## 🎯 What You **Must Focus On** (for learning or interviews)
| Version | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Angular 2** | Base of modern Angular – must understand |
| **Angular 9** | Ivy introduced – major shift |
| **Angular 14** | Standalone components simplify architecture |
| **Angular 16+** | Modern features like Signals, new reactivity |
| **Angular 18** | Latest version – always good to stay updated |

---

Why It's Fine to Jump from Angular 8 to 18
Angular is backward-compatible: Most of your Angular 8 knowledge (like components, services, routing, modules, lifecycle hooks) 
still applies in Angular 18.

Many new features are additive or optional: You don’t need to know every version in between — you can gradually 
adopt new features like Standalone Components, Signals, @if / @for, etc.

Modern best practices: Angular 18 simplifies architecture and improves performance.
 It’s better to learn what’s current than spend time on outdated patterns.
