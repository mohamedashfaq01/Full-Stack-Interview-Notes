MongoDB is a No SQL database. It is an open-source, cross-platform, document-oriented database written in C++.

In simple words, you can say that - Mongo DB is a document-oriented database. 
It is an open source product, developed and supported by a company named 10gen which is now known as MongoDB Inc.

The primary purpose of building MongoDB is:

1) Scalability
2) Performance
3) High Availability

Key points of MongoDB
Develop Faster
Deploy Easier
Scale Bigger

MongoDB stores data as documents, so it is known as document-oriented database.

Features of MongoDB
---------------------------
1. Support ad hoc queries
In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.

2. Indexing
You can index any field in a document.

3.Load balancing
It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.

4.It is a schema-less database written in C++.

5. Provides high performance.

6. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.

7. Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.


Databases can be divided in 3 types:
--------------------------------------------

1) RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
2) OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
3) NoSQL (recently developed database)

History behind the creation of NoSQL Databases
-----------------------------------------------
In the early 1970, Flat File Systems are used. Data were stored in flat files and the biggest problems with flat files are each company 
implement their own flat files and there are no standards. It is very difficult to store data in the files,
 retrieve data from files because there is no standard way to store data.

Then the relational database was created by E.F. Codd and these databases answered the question of having no standard way
to store data. But later relational database also get a problem that it could not handle big data, due to this problem 
there was a need of database which can handle every types of problems then NoSQL database was developed.

MongoDB advantages over RDBMS
----------------------------------
Although it is 100 times faster than the traditional database but it is early to say that it will broadly replace the traditional RDBMS.
 But it may be very useful in term to gain performance and scalability.
 
 A Relational database has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between these tables, 
 while in MongoDB there is no concept of relationship.
 
 1) MongoDB is schema less. It is a document database in which one collection holds different documents.
 2)There are no complex joins in MongoDB.'
 3) It is very easy to scale.
 4) It uses internal memory for storing working sets and this is the reason of its fast access.
 5) Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
 
Where to Use MongoDB?
---------------------------
	Big Data
	Content Management and Delivery
	Mobile and Social Infrastructure
	User Data Management
	Data Hub
	
Data Model Design
-----------------------
MongoDB provides two types of data models: â€” Embedded data model and Normalized data model.

Embedded data model: 
{
	_id: ,
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
	Personal_details:{
		First_Name: "Radhika",
		Last_Name: "Sharma",
		Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
	},
	Contact: {
		e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
		phone: "9848022338"
	},
	Address: {
		city: "Hyderabad",
		Area: "Madapur",
		State: "Telangana"
	}
}

Normalized Data Model
In this model, you can refer the sub documents in the original document, using references.

Employee:

{
	_id: <ObjectId101>,
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
}
Personal_details:

{
	_id: <ObjectId102>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	First_Name: "Radhika",
	Last_Name: "Sharma",
	Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
}
Contact:

{
	_id: <ObjectId103>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
	phone: "9848022338"
}
Address:

{
	_id: <ObjectId104>,
	empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	city: "Hyderabad",
	Area: "Madapur",
	State: "Telangana"
}

database
------------
There is no create database command in MongoDB. Actually, MongoDB do not provide any command to create database.

 you can create collection manually by "db.createCollection()" but not the database.
 
 show dbs(check the database list)
 use databaseName (to use specific database)
 db  (To show current db)
 db.dropDatabase()
