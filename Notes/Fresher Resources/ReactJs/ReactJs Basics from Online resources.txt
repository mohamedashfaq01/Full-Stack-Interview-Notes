React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.

instead of single conditional operator (? : null_) we can use &&
{isFlagSet && ('Hello')}

React is very decalative.
Building blocks for any front end framework.
1) COmponents
2) Props
3) Events.
4) State.


In ReactJS, we have mainly two types of components. They are

Functional Components
Class Components

Functional Components
In React, function components are a way to write components that only contain a render method and don't have their own state.
It is also known as a stateless component because they do not hold or manage state.

Class Components
Class components are more complex than functional components. It requires you to extend from React.
 Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
 
constructors:
 
In React, constructors are mainly used for two purposes:

It used for initializing the local state of the component by assigning an object to this.state.
It used for binding event handler methods that occur in your component.

React Component API
------------------------

Components in React refer to reusable, independent pieces of the user interface that either control structuring or achieve a specific utility or function.

State in React refers to the data pertinent to a component.

Props in React is similar to state, but refers to inherited state within child components from parent components.

This.setState() updates the state within a component by passing objects with relevant keys to the state.

the three most important methods available in the React component API.

1) setState()
2) forceUpdate()
3) findDOMNode()


what is a Hook?

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

 Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React features from function components.
 Their names always start with use.

Rules of Hooks

Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);

This JavaScript syntax is called “array destructuring”. It means that we’re making two new variables fruit and setFruit,
 where fruit is set to the first value returned by useState, and setFruit is the second. It is equivalent to this code:

State Hook
-----------------
It lets us add local state to React function components — which we did for the first time ever!

  var fruitStateVariable = useState('banana'); // Returns a pair
  var fruit = fruitStateVariable[0]; // First item in a pair
  var setFruit = fruitStateVariable[1]; // Second item in a pair

function handleOrangeClick() {
    // Similar to this.setState({ age: 12 })
    setAge(12);
  }
  
Props
--------------  
ParentComp.defaultProps = {
  cars = ['BMW', 'Audi', 'Ford'];
}

Now parent to child we have to pass like
<ChildComp coolCars={this.props.cars}/>  

propTypes. ( we can define the different types of each props) 

useNavigate(hook to redirect to another route. it's from v6.)
<Navigate to="/notFound'>


Redirect (we use it v5)




 https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server
 In order to run both client and server application we can use "concurrently" package.
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently (we cna run json server stuff and client application both)
 like "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\"  \"npm start\"" (when we run "npm run dev") it'll run both apps.
