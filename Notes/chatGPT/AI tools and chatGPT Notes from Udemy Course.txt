ChatGPT Complete Guide: Learn Midjourney, ChatGPT 4 & More (Udemy)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Main Types of Outputs:

Synthesizing Info - Summarize large amounts of content in a concise way.
Content Creation and Copy - Generate brand new content for a specific topic and purpose.
• Learning and Research - Get questions answered for extremely specific needs.
• Coding - Generate code, info on programming concepts and APIs, and debugging.

ChatGPT vs. Google:

ChatGPT and Google search are both AI-powered tools, but they differ in several ways:
1. Purpose: Google search is a search engine that helps you find links to information on the web, while
ChatGPT is an interactive tool that not only finds you the information you’re searching for but can
“intelligently” process that information and personalize for your needs/prompts.
2. Input: Google search requires a user to type in a query, whereas ChatGPT interacts with users in a
conversational or iterative manner, you must work with it to get the desired output such as asking follow up
questions. (Even if you don’t know what question to ask)
3. Output: Google search returns a list of web pages related to the query, whereas ChatGPT provides a
single answer or response. (40% of 1st clicks on google return to search page)
4. Scope: Google search has access to a vast amount of information on the web, while ChatGPT is limited to
the information it was trained on. (This will change with time)
In short, Google search is a tool to find information on the web, while ChatGPT is a conversational tool that
can help you find the right questions to ask and synthesize large amounts of information for your specific
needs.

GPT4:
1) Creativity (each sentence with a word from A-Z), 
2) Visual Input (what recipe can be made with these with image as input), 
3) Longer context(Text from: wiki link, descrive her abilities. etc)


Prompt Engineering:(

Prompt engineering is like a magical recipe that helps a computer understand what we want it to do.
 It's about giving the computer the right words and instructions so it can give us helpful answers. 
Just like telling a fairy exactly what you want, so she can grant your wish!

Prompt priming: (with some initial value)

Prompt priming is like giving a special hint to your computer friend before asking a question. 
It helps the computer understand what you're looking for and gives better answers. 
It's like telling your friend a little secret code that helps them find the right information faster.

 Instead of simply asking, "Tell me about ocean animals," you can prime the prompt by saying,
 "I want to learn about amazing sea creatures like dolphins, sharks, and colorful fish."
 
 
Practical Everyday Prompts

1) Generate Analogies:

Prompt Formula
• I'm trying to better understand the concept of [concept], please help me better understand this concept by creating a

Examples
• I'm trying to better understand the concept of photosynthesis, please help me better understand this concept by
creating a practical and easy to understand analogy.
• I'm trying to better understand the concept of search engine optimization, please help me better understand this
concept by creating a practical and easy to understand analogy 
 
2) Chain Of thought prompting

Formula: [Your Question]. let's think step by step.

Example:  
 What is the diameter of the sun? Let’s think step by step.
 What is the weight of an oxygen molecule? Let’s think step by step.
what is the diameter of Sun, explain that to a toddler and Let's think step by step?


Tabular Format:

simple: what are the main factors for growing a youtube channel? (or)
what are the different categories you can break your answer into for more descriptiveness?

tabular: Now create a table that includes your original answer with these categories separated into different columns?
(category, factor, explanation)
more: what other categories can you add to this table.
