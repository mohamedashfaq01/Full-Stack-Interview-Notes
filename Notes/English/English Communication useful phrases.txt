Real Life is about interaction(speaking, listening, interrupting, agreeing and disagreeing). 
Meetings are exactly same.

1) Let's throw some ideas on the table.
2) Let's brainstorm some ideas.
3) Does anyone wants to say anything on that?
 Would it be possible...?
 It's unavoidable..unfortunately
 Sorry to have to trouble u.
 I really must apologize.
 That's fascinating...That's interesting..
 Before we begin, can I

 I could be wrong, but i don't think.
 Yes..But.. (British culture)
 KISS Principle in Meeting(keep It Short and Simple)
 so on and so forth: It's same as etcetera.
 
 write up the minutes after the meetings.
 
 Politely expressing criticism.
 (Your performance in this quarter has been somewhat unsatisfactory, these sales figures are a bit disappointing)

8) I think we need to come up with a different angle, does anyone from sales want to say anything on that?


Giving neutral opinions (50 to 60% of sure what we're saying)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

crux of the discussion is
Your ultimate goal should be.
You should not keep quiet and keep creating a volcano, which will erupt someday later and produce lots of damages
Be communicative, be transparent and be honest.
try to keep yourself healthy, happy and active.
but let us eat the quantity, which we can digest easily.
There could be a list of thousands of best practices, which can be listed down by veteran software developers but let us eat the quantity, which we can digest easily.
Just keep your list small but follow them strictly throughout your developer's life.

I'm saying like half full and he's saying like half empty.

Do you find yourself hiding in the crowd and barely talking during meetings?

Learning
-------------
learning is: a process that results in a change in knowledge or behaviour as a result of some experience.

To be an effective learner:
1) Choose what matters.
2) Do what matters. (Playing Tennis is more important than watching it).
3) get help.

The best way to learn is by doing. Particularly by doing some task.

Motivation: A motivation is the drive to perform an ACTION.

self-reflection: serious thought about one's character and actions.
reflection: serious thought. Reflection is a way to make sure your mental model evolve.
reflection plays a key role in learning. It allows you to pause and check in with yourself as learn.
Visualize those goals, Regularly reminding yourself why you're doing what you're doing can be very helpful in achieving your goals.


Self-explanation.(It's also a great way of learning, we have to re-state the instaructions by our own words.
Learning with others. 
  (Exposes you to different perspectives and ideas.
  Helps broaden your understanding)
Repatations and Practice more:  
 Memory consist of three processes encoding, storing, and retrieval.
 Encoding: It's a process of turning information into a memory. (the more effectively you can encode. the better)
 Storage: It refers to how encoded data is held in the brain.
 Retrieval: It occurs when u need to access previously stored information. 
         (the retrieval depends on the encoded data, the more effectively encoded, the more easier to get it.)
		 for instance, encoding with an acronyms for example APSTNDP(For Network Layer). Remembering name of someone. by repeating it.

Schedule your learning time and commit to it.
and start with short time. (30 min exercise rather than 2 hour).
Schedule regular and repeated time with yourself to learn. 
keep it realistic, start small, and really commit to it.

Why Set Goals:
 Goals help you define and envision what you want to accomplish
 Goals can keep you motivated and on track.
 
How to set goals (SMART framework)

S - Specific
M - Measurable
A - Attainable/Achievable  (All resources or tools to acheive it)
R - Relevant/Realistic  (is it meaningful to u)
T - Time-Based 

(Learn how to write SMART goals).

best examples.
1) Build an App
By 30 June 2021 , I will build my first application  and publish it on play store.
 I've enrolled in the android development boot camp course .
2) course cpp
complete the july coding challenges on codechef and get a rating on codeforces by 25th july. june long challenge . 
3) Improve My Learning Efficiency
Finish the Course 
How to Learn: Effective Approaches for Self-Guided Learning
by the end of June 2021.
4) Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru
By Feb 20, I plan to complete this course and the Pet Clinic application.
5) Data Structure and Algorithm : Improving skill
I want to learn and understand the data structure and algorithm. I want to learn this because
 it is good to have in the skills as well as for experienced person when you are working as S/w developer. 
 To complete this course, going to complete in 1 months.

failure usually happens for two reasons.
1. Doing Things without thinking about them.
2. Thinking about things without doing them.
